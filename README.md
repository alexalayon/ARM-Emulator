These programs implement six functions in ARM assembly language and C.
The included programs are the following:

1. Quadratic equation
    Calculates the solution to the quadratic equation for the given parameters
    Files: quadratic_c.c and quadratic_s.s

2. Sum Array
    Calculates the sum of the integers in the array
    Files: sum_array_c.c and sum_array_s

3. Find Max
    Finds the largest number in an array of integers
    Files: find_max_c.c and find_max_s

4. Fibonacci sequence, iteratively
    Iteratively determines the value of the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
    Files: fib_iter_c.c and fib_iter_s.s

5. Fibonacci sequence, recursively
    Recursively determines the value of the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
    Files: fib_rec_c.c and fib_rec_s.s

6. String Length
    Counts the number of characters in a C string
    Files: strlen_c.c and strlen_s.s

The output includes the Registers data and the CPSR and the stack memory and direct-mapped cache
